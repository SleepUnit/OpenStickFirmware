<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

OSF is built with CircuitPython and intended to run on _any_ board it supports. Not only does this make the customization process friendlier for non-developers, but it also means a significant amount of power can be had for <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864">a mere four dollars</a>.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Once you're installed CircuitPython on your device of choice, setting up OSF is as simple as downloading the files from this repository and placing them on the drive that appears on your computer.

There's no need to compile anything or download additional software.
